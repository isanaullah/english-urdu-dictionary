<h1 style="font-size:22px;">Satellite</h1>
<br>

<hr style="margin-bottom:5px; border: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">

 <p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify;">
   You must have heard of this word “satellite” hundred times but I bet a vast majority doesn’t even know what satellite means, what is the definition of satellite or what does a satellite do? In this article we are going to provide you detailed information about all of the above mentioned things. A satellite is basically an abject that has been put in an orbit artificially around bigger objects to gather data and information. The satellites are of different types depending upon the tasks that they perform. Following are the major type of satellites. The provided satellites are nine in total and are used by number of organizations and institutions for relevant purposes.  
</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li>•   Communications Satellite</li>
    <li>•   Remote Sensing Satellite</li>
    <li>•   Navigation Satellite</li>
    <li>•   Geocentric Orbit type satellites - LEO, MEO, HEO</li>
    <li>•   Global Positioning System (GPS)</li>
    <li>•   Geostationary Satellites (GEOs)</li>
    <li>•   Drone Satellite</li>
    <li>•   Ground Satellite</li>
    <li>•   Polar Satellite</li>
    <li>•   Nano Satellites, CubeSats and SmallSats</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>
    <?php //echo Add_Res(); ?>
</p>

<br>

<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify;">
   You can get to know the individual tasks performed by these satellites by just looking at their names. Satellites have revolutionized the era and the world as we see it is definitely a result of that. Satellites have played quite important roles in the developing and organizing things and many organizations and departments are benefiting from it on daily basis. If we talk about many new products and services like GPS and google maps and satellite imaging is also a result of this technological revolution. Another are where satellite are used more often and the benefit that is taken from it can’t be ignore is defense. You must all be very well aware of the drone technologies and satellite monitoring. Satellite enables these technologies to monitor and execute operations in unsafe territories without putting human life in danger. If we talk about the galaxies and orbiting of multi planets it wouldn’t be wrong to say that it has been satellites are the first thing that got us familiarized with all those. 
</p>

<br>

<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify;">
   If we talk about our solar system there are dozens of natural satellites in it, to justify this system let me put an argument, each and every planet has at least a moon. So you can do the math by yourself and get the result to match it with my mentioned number. If this isn’t enough than let me mention another fact that only Saturn has 53 natural satellites with an artificial satellite that enabled us to know all about it. The artificial satellites have been recognized to world on the mid of 20th century. The first artificial satellite in fact was introduced by the Russians and the whole world was shocked with amazement. The world was amazed so much because since than it was believed that the soviets didn’t have that kind of technology. In today’s world the largest and mostly satellite using organization is NASA and have without provided information to the world that people didn’t have a clue about. 
</p>

<br>

<p style="font-size:14px; text-align:justify;">
   NASA also known as National Aeronautic and Space Administration, an independent US agency working for the civilian space program is quite well known in the world and don’t need an introduction. The agency was established in 1958 and since then beyond any doubt is one of the majorly satellite using agency. All of the systems and data collection is dependent on satellites and all that we know about the space and galaxies is just because of them or we should say because of satellites.
